# Dictation API

Upload an audio file and it returns a text transcription of the audio!

It uses the Google Speech API and currently only accepts .raw audio files. For now, try using ./public/audio/audio.raw.

Installation and runtime instructions:

```

git clone {repo}

cd {repo}

npm install

node app.js

Browse to http://localhost:3000

```

Note: You will need to enable the Google Speech API in your account and you may need to download your keyfile to the root of this main directory called keyfile.json.
